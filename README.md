## About the Project

BT Real Estate is a fictitious company, in which I made a website for.
 
This project was strictly centered around backend programming with Django. During the course, we learned how to connect a premade website template to a Postgresql server, and how to deploy said server using Blue Ocean.

## What I Learned

This project took me step-by-step through the development process of a dynamic web app. I learned how to write clean and more effective code using templates and partials, how to make the site dynamic using Jinja tags, how to implement and customize a content management system for both admins and users, how to set up a Postgresql database and how to manipulate the data with Django, and how to deploy with Blue Ocean.
